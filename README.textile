h1. XSL support for GraphML XML documents

I've forked gremlin to work on adding XSL support to render GraphML documents as HTML documents, with embedded SVG for vertices. 

Here is the source XML example of a GraphML-encoded graph :

"graph-example-1.xml":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/graph-example-1.xml

The XSL is broken into two parts : the first is specific to a particular graph, and encodes the actual positions and other quantities related to that graph: See example-specific XSL here:

"graph-example-1.xsl":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/graph-example-1.xsl

The other part is generically written for any GraphML graph:

"graphml.xsl":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/graphml.xsl

CSS here:

"graphml.css":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/graphml.css

and SVG (for vertices) here:

"vertex.xsl":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/vertex.svg

Compare with the "reference implementation" from the Gremlin documentation Wiki:

It depends on support for showing SVG images as part of <img> tag's src attribute. Currently only Safari seems to support this:
