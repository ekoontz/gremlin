h1. using XSLT to render GraphML XML documents as HTML with embedded SVG.

I've forked gremlin to work on adding XSLT support to render GraphML documents as HTML documents, with embedded SVG for vertices. 

Here is the source XML example of a GraphML-encoded graph :

"graph-example-1.xml":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/graph-example-1.xml

(Note that I manually annotated the XML with X and Y attributes to indicate my
preferred positioning : at some point, this X and Y annotation will be done automatically using a graph-drawing algorithm).

The XSL is generically written for any GraphML graph:

"graphml.xsl":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/graphml.xsl

CSS here:

"graphml.css":http://github.com/ekoontz/gremlin/blob/master/data/graphml.css

Compare with the "reference implementation" from the Gremlin documentation Wiki:

It depends on support for embedding SVG elements (the @svg@ tag) embedded insideHTML documents. Currently both Firefox and Safari support this: (Safari support shown).
